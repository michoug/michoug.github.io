abstract = {A novel hyperthermophilic, piezophilic anaerobic archaeon, designated as NCB100T, was isolated from a hydrothermal vent flange fragment collected in the Guaymas basin at the hydrothermal vent site named "Rebecca's Roost" at a depth of 1997 m. Enrichment and isolation were done at 100°C under atmospheric pressure. Cells of strain NCB100T are highly motile irregular cocci with a diameter of {\~{}}1 µm. Growth was recorded between 70 and 112°C (optimum 105°C) and hydrostatic pressures of 0.1-80 MPa (optimum 40-50 MPa). Growth was observed at pH 3.5-8.5 (optimum 7), and in 1.5{\%} - 7{\%} NaCl (optimum at 2.5-3{\%}). Strain NCB100T was strictly anaerobic chemoorganoheterotroph and grew on complex proteinaceous substrates such as yeast extract, peptone or tryptone, as well as on glycogen and starch. Elemental sulfur was required for growth and was reduced to hydrogen sulfide. The fermentations products from complex proteinaceous substrates are gluconic acid, pyruvate, CO2 and H2. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 41.3{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA genes revealed that strain NCB100T belongs to the genus Pyrococcus, showing 99{\%} of similarity with the other described Pyrococcus. Based on the physiological characteristics, G+C content, similarity level between ribosomal proteins and ANI value of 79{\%}, strain NCB100T represents a novel species for which, the name of Pyrococcus kukulkanii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NCB100T (=DSM 101590; Souchoth{\`{e}}que de Bretagne BG1337).},

abstract = {In this chapter the current knowledge of the diversity of piezophiles isolated so far is reviewed. The isolated piezophiles originated from high-pressure environments such as the cold deep sea, hydrothermal vents, and crustal rocks. Several " stress " conditions can be experienced in these environments, in particular high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). Discoveries of abundant life in diverse high-pressure environments (deep biosphere) support the existence and an adap-tation of life to HHP. At least 50 piezophilic and piezotolerant Bacteria and Archaea have been isolated from different deep-sea environments but these do not by far cover the large metabolic diversity of known microorganisms thriving in deep biospheres. The field of biology of piezophiles has suffered essentially from the requirements for high-pressure retaining sample containments and culturing labo-ratory equipment, which is technically complicated and expensive. Only a few prototypes of HHP bioreactors have been developed by a number of research groups and this could explain the limited number of piezophiles isolated up till now.},

abstract = {Prokaryotic viruses play a major role in the microbial ecology and evolution. However, the virosphere associated with deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Numerous instances of lateral gene transfer have contributed to the complex and incongruent evolutionary history of Thermotogales, an order well represented in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The presence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci has been reported in all Thermotogales genomes, suggesting that these bacteria have been exposed to viral infections that could have mediated gene exchange. In this study, we isolated and characterized the first virus infecting bacteria from the order Thermotogales, Marinitoga piezophila virus 1 (MPV1). The host, Marinitoga piezophila is a thermophilic, anaerobic and piezophilic bacterium isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney. MPV1 is a temperate Siphoviridae-like virus with a 43.7 kb genome. Surprisingly, we found that MPV1 virions carry not only the viral DNA but preferentially package a plasmid of 13.3 kb (pMP1) also carried by M. piezophila. This 'm{\'{e}}nage {\`{a}} trois' highlights potential relevance of selfish genetic elements in facilitating lateral gene transfer in the deep-sea biosphere.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s). 2018. Background: The plant compartments of Vitis vinifera, including the rhizosphere, rhizoplane, root endosphere, phyllosphere and carposphere, provide unique niches that drive specific bacterial microbiome associations. The majority of phyllosphere endophytes originate from the soil and migrate up to the aerial compartments through the root endosphere. Thus, the soil and root endosphere partially define the aerial endosphere in the leaves and berries, contributing to the terroir of the fruit. However, V. vinifera cultivars are invariably grafted onto the rootstocks of other Vitis species and hybrids. It has been hypothesized that the plant species determines the microbiome of the root endosphere and, as a consequence, the aerial endosphere. In this work, we test the first part of this hypothesis. We investigate whether different rootstocks influence the bacteria selected from the surrounding soil, affecting the bacterial diversity and potential functionality of the rhizosphere and root endosphere. Methods: Bacterial microbiomes from both the root tissues and the rhizosphere of Barbera cultivars, both ungrafted and grafted on four different rootstocks, cultivated in the same soil from the same vineyard, were characterized by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. To assess the influence of the root genotype on the bacterial communities' recruitment in the root system, (i) the phylogenetic diversity coupled with the predicted functional profiles and (ii) the co-occurrence bacterial networks were determined. Cultivation-dependent approaches were used to reveal the plant-growth promoting (PGP) potential associated with the grafted and ungrafted root systems. Results: Richness, diversity and bacterial community networking in the root compartments were significantly influenced by the rootstocks. Complementary to a shared bacterial microbiome, different subsets of soil bacteria, including those endowed with PGP traits, were selected by the root system compartments of different rootstocks. The interaction between the root compartments and the rootstock exerted a unique selective pressure that enhanced niche differentiation, but rootstock-specific bacterial communities were still recruited with conserved PGP traits. Conclusion: While the rootstock significantly influences the taxonomy, structure and network properties of the bacterial community in grapevine roots, a homeostatic effect on the distribution of the predicted and potential functional PGP traits was found.},

In silico analyses showed that the P. yayanosii genome is highly adapted to its harsh environment, with a loss of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathways and the high constitutive expression of the energy metabolism compared with other non-obligate piezophilic Pyrococcus species. Differential proteomics and transcriptomics analyses identified key hydrostatic pressure-responsive genes involved in translation, chemotaxis, energy metabolism (hydrogenases and formate metabolism) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats sequences associated with Cellular apoptosis susceptibility proteins.},

abstract = {The majority of the biosphere is a high pressure environment. Around 70{\%} of the marine biosphere lies at depths below 1000m, i.e. at pressures of 100 bars or higher. To survive in these environments, deep-biosphere organisms have adapted to life at high pressure. In vitro studies showed that the activity of certain proteins originating from deep-sea organisms is less affected by high pressure than that of enzymes from surface organisms . However, the genetic and structural bases for this increased pressure resistance are still unknown. Elastic incoherent neutron scattering studies, which provide access to information about molecular dynamics, constitute a very promising approach to decipher the structural adaptation in proteins living under high pressure. This approach has been used in the past to investigate the adaptation of biological systems to temperature and salinity and proved to be essential and complementary to structural studies. Here first investigations of high pressure effects on cell dynamics are presented using Thermococcales as models.},

abstract = {The RNA-guided nuclease CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated nuclease 9) and its variants such as nickase Cas9, dead Cas9, guide RNA scaffolds and RNA-targeting Cas9 are convenient and versatile platforms for site-specific genome editing and epigenome modulation. They are easy-to-use, simple-to-design, and capable of targeting multiple loci simultaneously. Given that cancer develops from cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations, CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-Cas9 systems) hold extensive application potentials in cancer modeling and therapy. To date, they have already been applied to model oncogenic mutations in cell lines1 and in adult animals2 , as well as to combat cancer by disabling oncogenic viruses3 or by manipulating cancer genome4 . Given the importance of epigenome and transcriptome in tumorigenesis, manipulation of cancer epigenome and transcriptome for cancer modeling and therapy is a promising area in the future. Whereas (epi)genetic modifications of cancer microenvironment with CRISPR-Cas9 systems for therapeutic purposes represent another promising area in cancer research. Herein, we introduce the functions and mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in genome editing and epigenome modulation, retrospect their applications in cancer modelling and therapy, discuss limitations and possible solutions, and propose future directions, in hope of providing concise and enlightening information for readers interested in this area.

abstract = {Trinucleotide repeat expansions are responsible for at least two dozen neurological disorders. Mechanisms leading to these large expansions of repeated DNA are still poorly understood. It was proposed that transient stalling of the replication fork by the repeat tract might trigger slippage of the newly-synthesized strand over its template, leading to expansions or contractions of the triplet repeat. However, such mechanism was never formally proven. Here we show that replication fork pausing and CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat instability are not linked, stable and unstable repeats exhibiting the same propensity to stall replication forks when integrated in a yeast natural chromosome. We found that replication fork stalling was dependent on the integrity of the mismatch-repair system, especially the Msh2p-Msh6p complex, suggesting that direct interaction of MMR proteins with secondary structures formed by trinucleotide repeats in vivo, triggers replication fork pauses. We also show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that Msh2p is enriched at trinucleotide repeat tracts, in both stable and unstable orientations, this enrichment being dependent on MSH3 and MSH6. Finally, we show that overexpressing MSH2 favors the formation of heteroduplex regions, leading to an increase in contractions and expansions of CAG/CTG repeat tracts during replication, these heteroduplexes being dependent on both MSH3 and MSH6. These heteroduplex regions were not detected when a mutant msh2-E768A gene in which the ATPase domain was mutated was overexpressed. Our results unravel two new roles for mismatch-repair proteins: stabilization of heteroduplex regions and transient blocking of replication forks passing through such repeats. Both roles may involve direct interactions between MMR proteins and secondary structures formed by trinucleotide repeat tracts, although indirect interactions may not be formally excluded.},
